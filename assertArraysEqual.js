/*
    - Implement assertArraysEqual which will take in two arrays and console.log an appropriate message to the console
    - The message will be similar to that of assertEqual. In fact, you could refer to the code for assertEqual to help you implement this. Instead of doing a simple === check though, this assertion function will make use of your eqArrays function for array comparison
    - unable to use assertions (test code) for this one
    - you can and should call the function below its declaration and visually ensure that the message printed to the console is accurate
*/
